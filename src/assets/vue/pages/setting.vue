      <p>The year is 3210, and it’s as you would expect it to be. Space flight, artificial intelligence,
        genetic modification, interstellar colonisation and laser guns. Except there isn’t an evil Empire 
        or galactic spanning Federation. Just trillions of people trying to make a living in the big ol’
        Black, anyway they can.</p>
      <p>While all of this is good, it used to be better. Intelligent life (yes, that includes humanity)
        use to explore, expand, and exploit their way across the Black (with an occasional extermination
        or two thrown in). We (sorta) controlled every inch of the galaxy, we (kinda) solved every technological
        challenge, and we (almost) wanted for nothing.</p>
      <p>That is until <b>The Surge</b> threw us all back into the stone ages.</p>
      <p>But we have recovered from the devastating effects of the Surge. We have discovered a slower but
        safer form of Faster Than Light (FTL) space flight, as well as all sorts of the other important
        technologies. The Black is once again ours to explore, budding with endless opportunity, enticing
        us to escape our planet-bound existence. It’s the only place where a person can truly be free in
        an age where everyone is constantly connected.</p>
      <p>And as the old saying goes, ”<em>once you go Black, you never go back</em>”.</p>

		  <f7-block-title  class="content-center-text color-lightblue bottom-border small-caps">In the beginning</f7-block-title>
      <p>Humanity, despite the set-backs, took their first steps into the Black back around the 1970’s.
        We somehow managed to escape ancient Earth using only simple ”propulsion thrusters” (engines that
        spewed matter out from one end to create movement in the other direction). It took us about another
        century to explore our local star system (humanity always was a late bloomer), and a further century
        to figure out how to terraform and colonize it. During that time we also figured out how to do real
        artificial intelligence, put computers inside of our brains, make deadly energy weapons, and all
        sorts of other cool technology.</p>
      <p>But the game-changer came with the invention of the <strong>Trans-Dimensional Drive</strong> during
        the 2200’s, commonly known as TDD. This special machine allowed us to bend the laws of Space-Time
        for FTL travel using what the tech-heads call ”trans-dimensional energy”. The TDD allowed us simple
        apes to escape our local star system and really explore the big ol’ Black.</p>
      <p>And, as it turned out, we were not the first to make the discovery of FTL travel. Sentient life was
        apparently common enough in the galaxy, and we soon made first contact with dozens of our alien
        neighbours. Humanity made a lot of new interstellar friends with whom we traded and travelled with
        (we may have nuked a couple of other species... but trust me, they were probably nasty). Some of the
        friendlier aliens had already formed a sort of ”federation of planets”, and after gaining acceptance
        humanity entered the brutal arena of galactic politics.</p>
      <p>We eventually learned about the side-effects of TDD tech. It just so happens that the human body begins
        to experience changes when you are exposed to trans-dimensional energy. Some people developed the
        ability to manipulate Space-Time itself, but most were just driven mad. The lucky ones became known as
        psionics, psychics, paranorms, or jsingshen. The old Federation created dedicated research centres to
        study and train psionics so that they could be a carefully controlled asset.</p>
      <p>It was a golden age for humanity. We colonized new star sectors and linked everything together using
        gigantic TDD Jump Portals. We created technological marvels, cracked cosmic puzzles, tamed toxic
        landscapes and even expanded the limits of our consciousness. The Black slowly fell to our insatiable
        curiosity.</p>
      <p>And then it all came crashing down.</p>

  		<f7-block-title class="content-center-text color-lightblue bottom-border small-caps">The Surge</f7-block-title>
      <p>We now call it <strong>The Surge</strong>, but we actually know very little about the event. Most
        tech-heads think it was a large shockwave of trans-dimensional energy that exploded from deep within the
        galactic center around about the 2800’s, which simply overloaded all of our TDD tech. In a matter of seconds
        everyone lost their Jump Portals, TDD engines and even psionics to The Surge.</p>
      <p>The aftermath was terrible. Many worlds began to starve as they relied on the food imports delivered to them
        by the extensive FTL trade network. Other worlds slid into barbarism as they fought over now dwindling
        resources. All across the Black, countless worlds began their struggle due to their sudden isolation.</p>
      <p>It was even worse for the psionics. All the adult psionics suffered a literal brain explosions during The
        Surge, leaving behind only their psionically attuned children (no one knows exactly why they were spared).
        The child psionics had to learn how to safely harness their powers without the guidance of experienced mentors.
        To make it worse, they had to endure the fear and loathing of the other non-psionic survivors as rumours spread
        that The Surge was the handiwork of psionics.</p>

		  <f7-block-title class="content-center-text color-lightblue bottom-border small-caps">Rebuilding the Galaxy</f7-block-title>
      <p>Over the last few centuries we have managed to rebuild. It isn’t quite like the old days, but we are
        slowly piecing it back together. The one saving grace was that non-TDD tech was spared. Many planets filled
        the gaps left by the destroyed TDD tech by adapting ”out-dated” tech. Some planets even refuse to advance
        further in fear that another Surge event could suddenly destroy all that they have rebuilt.</p>
      <p>In 3120, the Kaj tech-head Romazirash reverse engineered a safer (well, as Romazirash claimed) derivative
        of the TDD engine. It was called the <strong>Intra-Dimensional Drive</strong> (IDD). While it cannot travel
        across the whole galaxy in literal seconds, it could travel across multiple star systems in a matter of days.
        The new IDD drive allowed trade routes to be restored, and fledgling coalitions of planets began to carve out
        their small sections of galaxy to govern.</p>
      <p>We once again turns our hungry eyes towards the edges of the Black. Warlords and petty tyrants scheme to
        expand their stellar domain. Reclaimers plunder the ruins of worlds that did not survive. And psionics continue
        to practice their skills, under the distrustful eyes of those who see the use of trans-dimensional energy as an
        imminent threat to their way of life.</p>
      <p><strong>Good luck out in the Black!</strong></p>
      <p><em>P.S: Remember: It’s dangerous to go alone! Take friends.</em></p>
