Babylon 5: Aliens by Corey Marion

"It was the dawn of the third age of mankind..."

This is my second set based on the cult sci-fi series Babylon 5. It includes significant alien 
starships from the series. I originally intended for both to be done as a single set, but time caught 
up with me. I have completed this set to celebrate the airing of the final five episodes of Season 5.

Enjoy!

Star Trek: Starships by Corey Marion

"To boldly go where no man (one) has gone before..."

These icons are based on the starships from the Star Trek universe. This latest version includes all 
icons from my previous Starships sets as well as a couple of new ones from Star Trek: First Contact.

Enjoy!

Star Wars 3D Icon Collection Vol. 1 by Talos Tsui

We are all familiar with the movies, the score, the toys, even the new novels and the CD-ROM games...

The hype is building up, and we all are waiting for the new prequel.

How about icons that match the style of Copland and BeBox icons.?

Since I am a designer, I wanted to do an awesome icon collection which I am capable of. That's why I 
spent three weeks on and off working on this set of icons. There were tons of Star Wars icons out there
for people to download, but I guarantee this set of icons is nothing like you have seen before. It is 
definetly worth the few minutes of download time.

There were 39 of them, all in 3 quarter view, all done in Adobe Photoshop pixel by pixel, not from scans!
And they were touched up in ResEdit for the masking. They match the style of the Copland and BeBox icons.

35 vehicles and characters are chosen from the Star Wars triology: A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, and
Return of the Jedi. Plus, 4 new vechiles from the new "Star Wars: Shadow of the Empire" multimedia
frenzy coming this summer.

Hope you like these icons I created, and please email me your comments and feedback, and maybe what you
want to see in the next collection.


Thanks: We would like to say thank you to all of you who have written to let us know how much you like
our work on the icons. Since we don't charge money for any of our stuff, it is very gratifying to get
such a positive responses from everyone... thanks!

SPACE ICONS

July, 1997
Space by Gedeon Maheux

As a kid I spent a lot of time in planetariums, I mean A LOT. I loved space and the possibilities of one day 
exploring space and our solar system. I remember hearing about the Pioneer and Voyager missions to explore 
some of the outer planets, in fact I even did some school reports on them. Even though I never ended up 
becoming an astronaut, I still like to find nice dark fields and stare up at the sky. I share a passion for 
the universe that many others have dedicated their lives and careers to. As I write this, there are some very 
talented individuals at the Jet Propulsion Lab steering a little robotic rover around the surface of Mars... 
of Mars!

This icon set is dedicated to all the people at NASA, JPL and particularly the Johnson Space Center who have 
been in a bitter fight to keep their beloved Macs. These little pictures are to say thank-you for doing everything 
I always wanted but couldn't because I hated math! You all have very good reason to be proud of your accomplishments 
and I for one applaud you, bravo!

The enclosed folder contains 62 hand-drawn Space Icons. The Space Icon collection provides students, educators and 
people with a love for space, a way to put part of the solar system on their desktops. Every planet in the solar 
system as well as most of the major satellites are represented. In addition, many of NASA's space vehicles including 
Voyager, Pioneer, and the latest entry, the Sojourner Rover have a place in the collection. If you have an affinity 
for space, an interest in the planets or NASA then Space Icons are for you.
Thanks: It may sound kind of cheesy, but big thanks go out to the late Carl Sagan. Cosmos was one of my favorite TV 
shows as a kid and it only served to feed my hunger for knowledge about space. Sagan WAS a role model for many of us 
"nerd" kids and I'm glad I was able to appreciate at least some of what he tried to teach us about the universe and 
our place in it.
